The daily workflow transforms transient thoughts into permanent knowledge through a two-stage process.

## Start with daily notes
- **Open today's daily note** - Use `Open daily note` from the command palette
- **Log daily activities** - What you accomplished, learned, or discovered
- **Capture transient thoughts** - Ideas that may or may not become permanent
- **Reference existing notes** - Link to relevant evergreen notes using `[[Note Name]]`

## Process into evergreen notes
- **Move permanent concepts** from daily notes to the `Notes/` folder
- **Create atomic notes** - One concept per note, focused and self-contained
- **Use descriptive file names** - Make notes discoverable by their names
- **Link liberally** - Connect related ideas using wikilinks `[[]]` syntax

The key is distinguishing between temporal content (daily notes) and timeless knowledge (evergreen notes).

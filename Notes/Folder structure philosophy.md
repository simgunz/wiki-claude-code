## Our Minimal Approach

This vault intentionally uses a **minimal folder structure** based on modern PKM best practices. We've chosen simplicity over rigid organization.

## Current Structure

- **Home.md** - Main entry point and navigation hub
- **Notes/** - Evergreen notes and permanent knowledge
- **Seedbox/** - New ideas and temporary notes (inbox)
- **Journal/** - Daily notes and temporal content
- **Templates/** - Note templates for consistency
- **Attachments/** - Media files and documents

## Why Minimal Folders?

Most experienced PKM practitioners now lean toward **"as few folders as necessary"** because:

- **Search and linking are more powerful than ever** - Modern tools make finding content trivial
- **Over-categorization creates maintenance overhead** - Time spent organizing could be spent creating
- **Ideas don't fit neatly into predetermined categories** - Knowledge is interconnected and multifaceted
- **Tools like Dataview can create dynamic "folders" with queries** - Structure can emerge from content, not impose it

## Philosophy

We prioritize:
- **Connections over categories** - Links matter more than location
- **Organic growth** - Let structure emerge naturally
- **Reduced friction** - Minimize decisions about where things go
- **Focus on content** - More time thinking, less time filing

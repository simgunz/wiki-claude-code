Evergreen notes are written and organized to promote discovery and connections over time.

## Atomicity
- **Split large notes** as they grow beyond a single concept
- **Focus on one idea** per note to maintain clarity
- **Avoid creating huge pages** - Break them down when they become unwieldy

## Linking strategy
- **Use `[[]]` for connections** - Create bidirectional links between related notes
- **Link as you write** - Don't postpone connecting ideas
- **Check backlinks** - See what notes reference your current note at the bottom of each page
- **Follow link trails** - Discover unexpected connections through existing links

## Note evolution
- **Start rough, refine over time** - Notes improve through repeated visits
- **Update and expand** - Add new insights as understanding deepens
- **Merge or split** - Adjust note boundaries as concepts clarify

## Best practices
- **Link first, organize later** - Connections matter more than folder structure
- **Write for your future self** - Make notes clear and contextual
- **Review regularly** - Revisit notes to strengthen and expand them
- **Trust the process** - Let structure emerge organically from your thinking

The power comes from consistent linking and gradual refinement into a connected knowledge network.

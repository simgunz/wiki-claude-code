Obsidian provides several tools to navigate and discover connections in your knowledge network.

## Graph view

- **Find isolated notes** - Identify orphaned content that needs linking
- **Discover patterns** - See emerging clusters of related ideas
- **Navigate visually** - Click nodes to jump between connected notes

## Search and discovery
- **Use Omnisearch** - Enhanced search across all content
- **Browse backlinks** - Find notes that reference your current topic
- **Check unlinked mentions** - Discover potential connections

## Folder navigation
- **Notes/** - Permanent, evergreen knowledge
- **Journal/** - Daily logs and temporal thoughts

The tools work best when you focus on linking first, then use them to discover patterns that emerge naturally.
